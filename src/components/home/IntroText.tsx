      <H1>Hi There,</H1>
      <P className="w-full text-balance">
        Hi, I&apos;m Jordan Lambrecht, a Professional Something or Another based out of Lincoln,
        Nebraska.
      </P>
      <P className="w-full text-balance">
        Creating well-designed and personal moments that make people happy gets me out of bed in the
        morning - and keeps me up at night. As such, an off button is not part of my programming, be
        it with animation, web development, or any other outlet that involves making something exist
        that didn&apos;t before. When I&apos;m not staring at a computer, I&apos;m probably building
        something, killing plants, or shitty pots.
      </P>
      <P className="w-full text-balance">
        I&apos;m the Director and Founder of Pixel Bakery Design Studio and sit on the Board of
        Directors for the Lux Center for the Arts. Sometimes I host workshops, create tutorials, and
        do some public speaking.
      </P>
      <P className="w-full text-balance">
        I give credence to the idea that the critical components of a greater creative community are
        vulnerability, de-stigmatization of mental health, and equity.
      </P>
      <P className="w-full text-balance">
        I believe in free and open education, treating human beings like humans, and empowering
        those not as far along on their journey as I am.
      </P>
      <P>I believe in you. ❤️</P>
