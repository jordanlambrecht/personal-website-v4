              <Link href="https://pixelbakery.com"> Pixel Bakery Design Studio</Link> was a
              multidisciplinary production studio that tells brand stories using motion design,
              animation, and video production. I started PB over a decade ago with two of my college
              best friends, Tony Bertino and Karley Johnson. It was just the three of us in a tiny
              closet of an office that had no windows. We were young, hungry, and pretty naive about
              what running a business actually meant. We had no money, no clients, and absolutely no
              idea what we were doing.
            </P>
            <P>
              Fast forward to present, we&#39;ve had over 50 employees pass through our doors,{' '}
              <Link href={'https://pixelbakery.com/work'} target="_blank">
                hundreds of clients
              </Link>{' '}
              trust us with their brand, worked with some pretty big fish clients like L&apos;OrÃ©al,
              won 40+{' '}

              , and grossed millions in revenue.
            </P>
            <P>Our success came from two things.</P>
            <P>
              Our mission: we create intentional and beautiful moments for exciting people that
              share our beliefs and passions.
            </P>
            <P>And our values/beliefs:</P>
            <ul className="flex flex-col gap-2 list-disc list-inside mb-4">
              <li>
                Life is fleeting, and you only have so many days to craft the world you&apos;d like
                to live in.
              </li>
              <li>
                Our success is a direct result of the people in our lives. Our employees, our
                clients, and our community are vitally important to us.
              </li>
              <li>
                We are who we are and we treat everyone exactly the same. We practice this with
                vulnerability, constructive criticism, and honesty.
              </li>
              <li>
                If you&apos;re going to do something, do it right or don&apos;t do it at all. We
                don&apos;t take shortcuts.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <P>
              In May of 2025, I officially decided it was time to close our doors and see what the
              universe has in store for me next. I&apos;m proud of what I built and I will forever
              look back at the past decade I dedicated to building it as the best time of my life.

          One of my closely-held personal values is that knowledge should be shared. We built some
          pretty useful things over the years, and I want to share it with you rather than let it
          collect digital dust. I hope you find it useful.
        </P>
        <P>
          I&#39;ve packaged our most valuable resources: client onboarding workflows, project
          management frameworks, creative brief templates, production timelines, and quality
          assurance checklists, etc etc.
        </P>
        <P>
          Some were born from spectacular failures, others from gradual refinement. Some are
          incomplete, some are crazy intricate. None are perfect, but all are battle-tested. Take
          what works, improve what doesn&#39;t, and build something better.
        </P>
        <P>ðŸš§ This is a work-in-progress. It&#39;s a slow process. More soon.</P>
